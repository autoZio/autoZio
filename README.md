- 👋 Hi, I’m @autoZio
- 👀 I’m interested in Automation Projects and coding in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  Structured Text Language, VBs, Python and want to learn more...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything that catches my attention, as long as we keep in mind that "No great mind has ever existed without a touch of madness".
- 📫 How to reach me? You can message me!
